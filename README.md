# web-socket-domain-security
The WebSocketDomainSecurity project uses web sockets to validate and register a browser session with a set of services. If the browser session is valid, access is granted to the protected services.  Validation of the browser session is accomplished through randomized shared secrets and requiring the browser to verify its domain.
